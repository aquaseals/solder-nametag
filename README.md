# solder-nametag
My first PCB! A simple nametag with an  LED that lights up in the dark, and another LED whose light intensity fades in with a push of a button. I added pictures of the sun and moon to represent their presence in the form of the LED light depending on whether the surroundings are dark (night) or have ligh (day).
